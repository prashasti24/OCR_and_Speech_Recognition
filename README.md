# OCR_and_Speech_Recognition

Extract text from Image and PDF using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and Speech Recognition in a GUI application. There comes a time when you come across images and PDFs containing important textual content, which you want to extract for further use, what will you do ? Most of you may type the words or phrase in a separate Word document or a notepad. But this process can consume an ample amount of time. Fortunately, a new technology was developed to extract text from image, which they refer to as OCR. This Project illustrates how we can extract text from images as well as PDF files using OCR (Optical character recognition).OCR is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.OCR is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. With OCR this project uses ‘Python-tesseract’, an OCR tool for python. It will recognize and read the text present in images. It can read all image types - png, jpeg, gif, tiff, bmp etc. It’s widely used to process everything from scanned documents. Far from a being a fad, the overwhelming success of speech-enabled products like Amazon Alexa has proven that some degree of speech support will be an essential aspect of household tech for the foreseeable future. The accessibility improvements alone are worth considering. Speech recognition allows the elderly and the physically and visually impaired to interact with state-of-the-art products and services quickly. The first component of speech recognition is, of course, speech. Speech must be converted from physical sound to an electrical signal with a microphone, and then to digital data with an analog -to-digital converter. Once digitized, several models can be used to transcribe the audio to text. Finally, the GUI application using the tkinter package is cross – platform, stable, reliable.
